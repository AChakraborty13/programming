/**
 *
 * Boolean is a special data type that is used to represent truth values: true and false.
 * Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions.
 *
 * true and false are the only two primitive boolean values.
 * But more complex boolean expressions can be represented using logical operators.
 *
 * In addition, Groovy has special rules (often referred to as Groovy Truth) for coercing non-boolean objects to a boolean value.
